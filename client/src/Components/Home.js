            <p>I'm a musician born and raised in the North East of Scotland in a little town called Elgin. <br/>
            I'm a singer/songwriter/producer and multi instrumentalist with a passion for creating songs that tell a story. </p><p>My style is defiantly pop/rock with little pulls and feels from R&B and Folk. When performing solo I will normally play acoustically and really focus make a connection with the audience with my vocals and the raw feel of the sound.</p>
            <p>When I'm with the band I can't resist jamming out and really playing to create an amazing atmosphere and have as much fun as possible.</p>
            <p>I'm always working on new music and different styles of songs so keen an eye out for new releases. 
            I'm proud to say I've played previously at Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival, Thunder In The Glens. <br/>I have had my songs played on BBC radio and many other radio shows in Scotland. </p>
